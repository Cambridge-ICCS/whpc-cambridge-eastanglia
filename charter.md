# Cambridge & East Anglia WHPC Charter

## Who we represent

We represent people who identify as women or non-binary ("women+") using or working in HPC. We aim to support inclusivity and diversity for underrepresented groups in the HPC community.

## What we do

We plan to support our WHPC Chapter members with three main projects
Network & Partnerships

* Collaborate & partner with businesses, academic institutions & organisations to work towards our shared goals
* Establishing & maintaining relationships with those partners

Chapter Community

* Organise meetups
* Publish communications via social media, mailing list & our website
* Update community on existing and upcoming partnerships

Outreach

* Introduce HPC to women+ in secondary & higher education

## Who we are

Our committee is structured in the following way: 

* Chair
* Deputy Chair
* Chapter Leads
  * Network & Partnerships
  * Chapter Community
  * Outreach

## How we operate

* Roles are allocated for a fixed term-period (1 year), with the expectation that other members will rotate into them at the end of the period
* The aim of the fixed-term period is to promote new ideas & innovation
* Deputy is encouraged to assume role as chair (although not obliged)
* A cross-over period of 3 months is intended between the deputy to chair transition, before the end of the term to promote continuity
* A term's start and end date is defined by the submission of the annual report to WHPC
