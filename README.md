## Upcoming Events

### Thursday 27th March 2025 - RSEEE + WHPC Cambridge&East Anglia Kick-Off Event

Greetings one and all. The folks at WHPC (Women in HPC) Cambridge & East Anglia, and RSE East of England, are preparing to host
their first event as a joint venture, bringing together old friends and new to celebrate and enthuse about our work. The theme
for this event is "Show up & Show off". We will have a mix of stand-up talks and group sessions to hear people talk about what
projects they are excited about in the world of HPC and/or research software. Is there a research project that's grabbed your
attention, maybe a piece of software or code that you think is making waves? Perhaps you've been bringing people together in
your own community and would like to share how it went. Whatever it may be, we'd love to invite you to Cambridge for an
afternoon of sharing and an evening of networking. And even if you don't wish to talk, we'd love for you to come and listen,
learn, and liaise (because who doesn't love a bit of alliteration)

Date: Thursday 27 March 2025
Time: 12:00 - 17:30
Location: West Hub, JJ Thomson Ave, Cambridge CB3 0US
